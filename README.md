Hi there, welcome to my profile. Don't know what you expected to find here, but this is what you get.

In terms of coding and development, I tend to focus mostly on enhancing other projects that I want to use. Within this, I have a few key topics around which my interests lie.
Specifically, you'll likely find me spending my time helping on projects for:
- sim-racing, especially iRacing
- 3D printing
- gaming hardware reverse-engineering and compatibility
- rhythm games and associated controller works
- live-streaming
- Arduino development

In terms of programming languages used, I tend to have enough familiarity with some of the more common languages; depending on the project, I have worked with Python, Visual Basic, the C family of languages, HTML, JavaScript, and others.

Generally, if I'm creating something from scratch, it's because I've seen something I want to achieve for myself, and then made public. 

If you need to reach me off-site, I can be found on Twitter at @DragRedSim. Be warned that I am not necessarily the most prompt responder, and it may take me a while to get to you; I do struggle with overloading from too many different tasks and topics to consider.
